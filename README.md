# android-fingerprint-locator

## Android app for indoor positioning using WiFi fingerprinting using Firebase as backend

## How it works

### Lets say we are in an university or an hospital, ideally each floor would have a QR code somewhere so anybody could use it to access the map of that floor<br>
### The app reads the QR code and gets a map from the firebase database, then we can locate ourselves using the app

#### It has two types of users:<br>
#### Normal user: can see the map from the place where he is and get his location
#### Premium user: can see the map from the place where he is, can get his location and can set new reference points in the map (this new reference points are stored in the database)
